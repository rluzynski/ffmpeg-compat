# ffmpeg-compat

This is a fork of the original ```ffmpeg-compat``` package for RPM Fusion.
The package has been retired upstream but here I maintain some
[branches](https://github.com/rluzynski/ffmpeg-compat/branches)
for currently existing Fedora systems.

You can download binaries from http://lingonborough.com/downloads.
